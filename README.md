What I would do better with more time :
- Create a better UI.
- I would add NLogger for logging.
- Swagger documentation for the Api.
- The full version of AG Grid has master child feature that would have been perfect to show additional data on click. I've had to use alerts as I was using the community version.
- Would have liked to use toaster messages for notifications and alerts.
- use environment variables in angular for the middleware api endpoint. 
- I would have the AGGrid as a separate component that would make code a bit more cleaner.
- Ideally, would have a branching strategy something like master -> develop -> feature.
